## Description

The purpose of this service is to enable automatic email notifications to
users for all serious issues found in their OpenShift clusters. The "instant"
mode of this service runs as a cronjob every fifteen minutes, and it sends a
sequence of events to the configured Kafka topic so that the
[notification-backend](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/notifications-backend)
can process them and create email notifications based on the provided events.
The events are only created for the **important** issues found in the 
`new_reports` table of the configured PostgreSQL database. Once the reports are
processed, the DB is updated with info about sent events by populating the
`reported` table with the corresponding information. For more info about 
initialising the database, take a look at the [ccx-notification-writer repository](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/ccx-notification-writer).

In the instant notification mode, one email will be received for each cluster 
with important or critical issues.
