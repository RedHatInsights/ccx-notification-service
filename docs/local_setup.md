## Prerequisites

This service needs a Kafka broker and PostreSQL database. You can run the required containers using Docker-compose:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  db:
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/postgresql-10-rhel7
    environment:
      - POSTGRESQL_USER=user
      - POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
      - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=notification
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper
    environment:
      - ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=32181
      - ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID=1
      - ZOOKEEPER_LOG4J_LOGGERS=zookeeper.foo.bar=WARN
      - ZOOKEEPER_LOG4J_ROOT_LOGLEVEL=WARN
      - ZOOKEEPER_TOOLS_LOG4J_LOGLEVEL=ERROR
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka
    ports:
     - 29092:29092
    depends_on:
     - zookeeper
    environment:
      - KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://kafka:29092
      - KAFKA_BROKER_ID=1
      - KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1
      - KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:32181
      - KAFKA_LOG4J_LOGGERS=kafka.foo.bar=WARN
      - KAFKA_LOG4J_ROOT_LOGLEVEL=WARN
      - KAFKA_TOOLS_LOG4J_LOGLEVEL=ERROR
createtopics:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka
    entrypoint:
     - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - "/bin/kafka-topics --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 --create --topic logs --partitions 1; "/bin/kafka-topics --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 --create --topic platform.notifications.ingress --partitions 1; exit 0;"
    depends_on:
     - kafka
```

Apart from this, it is necessary to make some adjustments to `localhost` line at `/etc/hosts`:
```127.0.0.1       localhost kafka```

## Usage

The idea is:
1. Publish messages from `insights-results-aggregator-data` with `insights-results-aggregator-utils` to a Kafka topic.
2. Read those messages with `ccx-notification-writer` and save them to a PostgreSQL database.
3. Start the insights-content-service
4. Launch the `ccx-notification-service`. It should retrieve the rules content, and the info from the PostgreSQL database, and publish the corresponding notifications to the configured topic.

So it is necessary to clone the rest of the repositories before using the `ccx-notification-service`. 

### Insights results aggregator data and utils

It is necessary to clone [insights-results-aggregator-utils](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-results-aggregator-utils) to send the data to Kafka. The example messages are inside [insights-results-aggregator-data](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-results-aggregator-data), so clone it too.

Install [kafkacat](https://rmoff.net/2020/04/20/how-to-install-kafkacat-on-fedora/) and generate some messages with `produce.sh`:

```
cd insights-results-aggregator-data/messages/normal_for_notification_test
/path/to/insights-results-aggregator-utils/input/produce.sh
```

This script will publish all `.json` files in the folder. These messages can be seen inside Kafka using a consumer
```
kafkacat -C -b kafka:29092 -t ccx.ocp.results
```

### Insights content service

Clone [insights-content-service](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-content-service) and run `./update_rules_content.sh` in order to generate the folder with the rules. Then run the REST API with:

```
INSIGHTS_CONTENT_SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/insights-content-service/config-devel.toml ./insights-content-service
``` 

This service will be consumed by `ccx-notification-service` just for getting the templates.

### Notification writer

It is necessary to use `ccx-notification-writer` to consume some Kafka messages and write them to the DB:

```
// Initialize the database
CCX_NOTIFICATION_WRITER_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/ccx-notification-writer/config-devel.toml ./ccx-notification-writer -db-init-migration
CCX_NOTIFICATION_WRITER_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/ccx-notification-writer/config-devel.toml ./ccx-notification-writer -db-init
// Start the service
CCX_NOTIFICATION_WRITER_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/ccx-notification-writer/config-devel.toml ./ccx-notification-writer
```

### Notification service

```
CCX_NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/ccx-notification-service/config-devel.toml ./ccx-notification-service -instant-reports
```

The `instant-reports` flag doesn't publish anything to the Kafka topic because it doesn't find any difference between the reports in the DB. However, the `weekly-reports` does. If you want to use `instant-reports`, it is necessary to send messages with higher risk.

### Bonus: generating emails

It is possible to reproduce the generation of emails by cloning the [notifications-backend](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/notifications-backend/). You can run it with Quarkus and create a single test like the ones inside [TestOpenshiftAdvisorTemplate](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/notifications-backend/blob/master/backend/src/test/java/com/redhat/cloud/notifications/templates/TestOpenshiftAdvisorTemplate.java#L26). The variable `result` is the generated email. Make sure to fill the [stub action](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/notifications-backend/blob/9ba06e86d69b75a7f3169cf9a950f82b762032ef/backend/src/test/java/com/redhat/cloud/notifications/TestHelpers.java#L226) with the messages produced by the `ccx-notification-service`.

### Bonus: populating DB with correct data

It is possible to fill the PostgreSQL data directly with data that has the correct format by retrieving it from our QA database. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the QA openshift cluster using the `oc` tool: `oc login <cluster_URL> --token=<token>`
2. Get the `ccx-notification-db` pod identifier with `oc get pods`
3. Enter the pod with `oc rsh <pod>`
4. Create a backup of the database under `/tmp`
5. Logout from the pod
6. Retrieve the backup with `oc rsync <pod>/tmp/<backup_file> .`
7. Populate your local database with the downloaded file: `psql -U <postgres_user> <local_database_name> <backup_file>`

That's it. You will still need the insights-content-service and Kafka to be running in order to launch the notification service. But the remaining dependencies would not be needed anymore.

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure to read the contents of `config-devel.toml` at every repositories as it has all the configuration about the connections to the containers (database access, topics, other services endpoints...).

* If you get stuck, you can always drop the tables from the database using 
```
CCX_NOTIFICATION_WRITER_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/ccx-notification-writer/config-devel.toml ./ccx-notification-writer -db-drop-tables
```

## Running BDD Testcases

The BDD testcases can be run with `make bdd_tests`, or within any Python IDE as long as the virtual environment with the required packages is activated.
When the tests are launched, the `config-devel.toml` file is used. So for the testcases to run correctly, the following dependencies must be available:
- `Kafka` broker listening on `localhost:29092`
- `insights-content-service` on `localhost:8082`
- `PostgreSQL` on `localhost:5432` with a database named `notification`
- `Prometheus Push Gateway` on `localhost:9091`
